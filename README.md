# CodeBrix Samples
CodeBrix is a - so-far experimental - comprehensive rapid-application development (RAD) platform for quickly creating apps for iOS, Android and Windows (UWP); and is based on Xamarin.Forms and Prism.
This repository is intended for samples that demonstrate how to use various CodeBrix (and Prism) features with Xamarin.Forms, UWP and WPF applications.

As of January 2018, only samples for Xamarin.Forms are complete and available.
